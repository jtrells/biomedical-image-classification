Theproposed model of Inc organization is based on mass spectrometry-identiﬁed chlamydial Inc proteins, inwhich IncA-APEX2 and IncF-APEX2 proximity labeling constructs and bacterial adenylate cyclase two-hybrid (BACTH) assays were used to test protein-protein interactions. Based on these data, we proposefour possible scenarios for the spatial organization of Incs and how these Incs were detected using theAPEX2 proximity labeling system: scenario 1, IncF interacts with CT226, which binds LRRF1; scenario 2,IncA interacts with CT226, which binds LRRF1; scenario 3, IncA binds IncF and CT226, which binds LRRF1;and scenario 4, IncA, CT223, IncF, and CT226 (which binds LRRF1) all interact with each other. CT223 wasstatistically signiﬁcant by SAINT analysis from the mass spectrometry data and was able to interact withIncF and IncA by BACTH.

The quantification of SLO-1 puncta number was performed in cimIs10 animals whose genetic background is wild-type, unc-2 or unc-13animals. The data are presented as the mean ± SEM and analyzed by two-tailed Student t-test (wild-type, n = 14; unc-2, n = 11; unc-13, n = 12 ***p < 0.001,n.s., not significant). Scale bar, 5 μm.

(A, B) An integrated SLO-1::GFP array cimIs10was crossed with wild-type (A) or unc-2 (B) animals carrying the integrated RAB-3::mCherry array cimIs14. Arrowheads indicate SLO-1 puncta thatare not co-localized with clusters of synaptic vesicles shown by RAB-3 puncta. The scale bars represent 5 μm. (C) Co-localization between SLO-1::GFPand RAB-3::mCherry in wild-type and unc-2 animals was analyzed with JACoP, an ImageJ plugin [44]. Manders’ coefficient M1 is defined as the ratio ofthe summed intensity of GFP pixels overlapped with mCherry to total GFP intensity, whereas M2 is conversely defined. M1 coefficients inwild-type (n = 5) and unc-2 (n = 4) animals are significantly different, whereas M2 coefficients in both animals are not different (Student t-test,n.s., p = 0.34; *p = 0.013).

There are obvious gaps in the seam cells, where the seam cell fate has been transformed tohypodermal. Asterisks indicate nuclei that inappropriately express dpy-7::yfp instead of scm::tdTomato. Note that these cells have lost their PH::gfp outline,also indicative of transformation towards the hypodermal fate. ii and v are images of the GFP/YFP channel. iii and vi is the red channel to show the tdTomatoin the same animal. i and iv are merged imaged of both GFP/YFP and tdTomato channels. All scale bar, 20 mm. Anterior is to the left and dorsal up in allimages. (D) Representative image of a trd-1(RNAi) animal displaying shallow or absent alae. Scale bar, 40 mm (E) Representative lineage trace showing theVn lineage from hatching to late L2. In wild type animals at the L1 stage, Vn divides asymmetrically with the anterior daughter (Vn.a) adopting thehypodermal fate and the posterior daughter (Vn.p) retaining the proliferative fate. Vn.p will divide symmetrically during early L2 followed closely by a furtherasymmetric division. Vn.pap and Vn.ppp retain the ability to self-renew and will divide again at L3 and L4. We lineaged 7 trd-1(RNAi) animals, of which 5 hadsymmetrized the L1 asymmetric division of V2 (asterisk). In animals that divided in the wild type pattern at the L1 division (2 animals), the L2 asymmetricdivisions were again symmetrized towards the hypodermal fate (1). Similar cell fate transformation events were observed in the other V lineages, albeit atlower frequency.	TRAIN	GRAPHICS,OTHER	False	False	False	False	False	False	1	daniela		True		1

(B) Additional experiment comparing wild‐type tobiopterin deficient worms, with or without supplemental sepiapterin, including cat‐4(ok342). Results like in (A). A customary approach inmammalian cells to increase BH4 intracellularly is to use sepiapterin (Werner‐Felmayer et al. 2002; Aguado et al. 2006), since SR caneffectively convert sepiapterin to 7,8 dihydrobiopterin (BH2) intracellularly, which is then reduced to BH4 by dihydrofolate reductase(DHFR). In C. elegans, we believe that other reductases substitute for SR and carry out the last steps in the synthesis of BH4 (since there isno ortholog); these enzymes should also be able to convert sepiapterin to BH2, the latter being further reduced to BH4 by DHFR in the so‐called salvage pathway (Thöny et al. 2000).

Serotonin immunoreactivity (5HT-IR) in NSM somas and neurites of young (L1–L2)worms. Mixed populations of wild type (N2), single, and double mutant worms were scored by serotonin antibody staining. Staining deﬁnitions are as follows:strong, somas bright (saturated staining, no internal features apparent) and neurites bright; medium, somas not saturated, may show some internal structure(i.e., a nucleus may be seen), neurites present; weak/faint, somas visible (may be just above background), neurites absent or very faint; and none, no stainedstructures apparent. (A) pcbd-1(tm5924) mutants display at most a mild reduction in 5HT-IR. Double mutant pcbd-1; cat-4(rof) worms display almost no 5HT-IR;cat-4(rof) = reduction of function allele = e3015. (B) Loss of 5HT-IR in qdpr-1 mutant worms. Wild type (N2), qdpr-1, cat-4, and double mutant qdpr-1; cat-4worms scored as described in A. qdpr-1(a) = tm2337; qdpr-1(b) = tm2373.

These nlg-1 ampliﬁcations were resolved on agarose gels and the molecular size (bp) of molecular weight markers indicated onthe left. Those major bands extracted from the gels and subjected to sequencing are indicated by arrow lines or asterisks. These excised cDNAs were investigated by se-quencing. The chromatograms to the right (Ai) evidence the SL-1 splicing in the 5′ end of the gene and (Aiii) the splice variants obtained from ampliﬁcations designed toresolve the 3′ end of the gene. This sequencing identiﬁed a 5 nt sequence-variant in exon 14 (highlighted in red capital letters). Boxes and chevrons represent exonic andintronic sequences, respectively. The grey boxes represent untranslated sequences that are 3′ of the ampliﬁed cDNAs and are predicted from the C. elegans database. Thearrows indicate the primers position within transcripts. The asterisks denote nonspeciﬁc product found. (B) Translated NLG-1 isoforms. The translated amino acid se-quences of the relevant splice variants are indicated in context the whole gene (upper) depicted as exons (boxes) and introns (chevrons). The amino acid sequence showsthe predicted protein sequences that arise from these splice variants relative to the transmembrane domain and the C-terminal PDZ ligand (bold) The translation of cDNAsequences was performed using the EMBOSS Transeq (EMBL-EBI) program.

While homogenous expression of PIX-1::GFP in these cells rescues elongationdefects of pix-1(gk416), we cannot exclude the possibility that pix-1 may be required only in a subset of these cells. In PIX-1-expressing cells, PAK-1 isactivated in a GTPase-dependant (through activation of CED-10 by PIX-1 and/or UNC-73) or in a GTPase-independent manner (by PIX-1 directly). LET-502 is activated only in seam cells through activation of RHO-1 by RHGF-2. PIX-1 may also activate MRCK-1 through CDC-42 upstream of MEL-11.Following this model, the contraction pressure applied on the actin cytoskeleton is similar in ventral and dorsal hypodermis and higher in seams cells.Arrows represent relative contraction forces within each cell.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0094684.g007	TRAIN	GRAPHICS,OTHER	False	False	False	True	False	False	1	daniela		False		1

We propose DAF-16 directly binds the natc-1 promoter andrepresses transcription. natc-1 transcription and translation promotesactivity of the NatC complex, which is predicted to acetylate multipleproteins. However, the role of specific target proteins that modulatestress resistance and dauer larvae formation has not been established.doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004703.g008	TRAIN	GRAPHICS,FLOWCHART	False	False	False	False	False	False	1	daniela		False		1

In vitro kinaseassays of twitchin kinase show that NL and CRD each inhibits kinase activity by one-half. Moleculardynamic simulations indicate that the mechanically sensitive portion is NL, 45 residues lyingbetween the Fn3 domain and the catalytic core, and that the CRD remains attached to the largelobe of the kinase even after the small lobe has been unwound (von Castelmur et al., 2012).Therefore MAK-1 might contribute to the removal of the CRD segment from the catalytic core bybinding or by phosphorylation. The nematode MAK-1 paralogues, MNK-1 and MAK-2, are alsoexpressed in muscle, and each alone and the two in combination show partial resistance tonicotine. Thus MNK-1 and MAK-2, in addition to MAK-1, may be involved in activation. MAPKAP that includes putative promoter sequencekinase 2 in mammals is activated by phosphorylation by p38 MAP kinase. The nematodeorthologues of p38 MAP kinase include PMK-1 and -3. Their null mutants show an intermediateresistance to nicotine. Therefore it is possible that PMK-1 and -3 are also upstream components ofthis relaxation pathway. Rather than full activation, it is possible that partial activation by force andpartial activation by MAK-1 occur independently to meet different physiological requirements.

Twelve small food patches were placed at the edge of a 9cm culture plate; control (Pgpa-4Δ6::GFP) and odr-10ON males were placed in alternatingspots. In the center, four paralyzed unc-31 adult hermaphrodites were placed in a small foodspot. A ring-shaped barrier food patch was seeded in between the center spot and theperipheral spots.

The increased GFP in glp-1 is visible in intestinal nuclei (compare A and B)and is abolished in daf-16;glp-1 animals (C). tcer-1;glp-1 mutants exhibit high expression in some gut cells but no GFP in others (D). The bar graph in Eshows the quantification of these data obtained from day 2 young adults of each strain classified into those with high (green), medium (peach), andlow (gray) GFP. In the tcer-1;glp-1 bar, the high GFP class is shown as spotted green to indicate that these worms showed high but mosaic intestinalexpression.

Model Of A Neural Circuit That Integrates Food Sensory Cues With Nutritional StatusTo Promote Experience-Dependent Plasticity of FeedingState 1: the activity of AVA (hexagon) is attenuated by KynA synthesized from kynurenineby NKAT-1 in RIM, RMDV and/or RID (circle). Kynurenine is ultimately derived fromingested food. ADF (triangle) senses food cues leading to 5-HT secretion to stimulatepumping. State 2: fasting represses KynA production causing activation of AVA neuronsthat promotes FLP-18/NPR-5 signaling to serotonergic ADF. In the absence of food cues,serotonin signaling from ADF is muted. State 3: when animals re-encounter foodimmediately post-fast, the activated NPR-5 signaling state leads to enhanced secretion fromADF when food derived sensory cues are detected. Continued feeding leads to anaccumulation of KynA returning the animals to State 1.	TRAIN	GRAPHICS,FLOWCHART	False	False	False	False	False	False	1	daniela		False		1

The nature of the molecular lesions we isolated is asfollows: rp13 is a 517-bp out-of-frame deletion that removes the ﬁrst twozinc ﬁngers, and rp15 is a C to T transition that converts an arginine to anopal stop codon early in the protein sequence. (B) Quantiﬁcation of rp13-induced BAG defects in reporters for BAG neuronal fate. Loss of egl-46affects ﬂuorescent reporter expression of the neuropeptide ﬂp-19 and theguanylyl cyclases, gcy-9 and gcy-31.

Brightness intensities were measured in a 200-pixel-wide stripeacross gut pictures as shown in A–F. The length of the graphs is 400 pixels and corresponds tothe width of the gut (indicated as distance on the x-axis; note that the gut lumen is centered at200 pixels in these plots, apical membranes are directly adjacent to the lumen on both sides,and basal membranes are on the left and right). Curves from five worms were averaged andnormalized to minimal (background outside the cell) and maximal values. The averagebackground inside the cell is indicated by a hatched line and is similar to the value in the centerof the graph, where the gut lumen lies. In wild type, GFP::RAB-5 signal is brightest near theapical membrane and decreases to the basal side, whereas mCherry::RAB-7 shows a peak moredistant to the gut lumen. In sand-1(ok1963), both signals are equally distributed across the gutcells, reflecting a loss of normal localization.

(D) A DICimage overlaid with a marker for the AC (mCherry::PLCδPH, magenta) shows avab-10(e698) mutant (top) that failed to invade (BM is not breached as indicated by intactphase-dense line, arrowhead). Expression of VAB-10A in the AC (cdh-3>vab-10a::GFP,inset) rescued the invasion defect (arrowhead indicates BM breach; n=41/44 animals withcomplete invasion). (E) Hemicentin punctae (green) are contained within the region of AC-BM contact (outlined by dotted line, AC in magenta). Following treatment with RNAitargeting vab-10a, the hemicentin punctae were no longer contained within the AC footprint(bottom, arrowheads). (F) The graph quantifies the percentage of punctae in wild-type andvab-10 RNAi treated animals outside the AC footprint (*p<0.05, Fisher’s exact test, ≥100animals for each treatment, error bars show 95% confidence interval with a continuitycorrection).

A genecascade that begins with maternal SKN-1 progresses through activationof med-1,2 in EMS, which in turn activate tbx-35 in MS. POP-1represses endoderm speciﬁcation in MS. In E, the sister of MS, aWnt/MAPK-dependent mechanism represses tbx-35 through anunknown effector (not shown). TBX-35 acts upstream of genes thatspecify pharynx and muscle fates, through regulators such as pha-4 andhlh-1, respectively (Gaudet and Mango, 2002; Krause et al., 1990).TBX-35 also represses targets of maternal PAL-1, blocking C fates.Activation of med-1,2 by SKN-1 is direct (Maduro et al., 2001), as isactivation of tbx-35 by MED-1,2 (this work). In addition to med-1,2,SKN-1 also activates the expression of one or more Delta/Serrate/Lag(DSL) proteins that enable the MS cell to signal the AB lineage to makeanterior pharynx (Priess et al., 1987).

The left end of the gene is preceded by the start codon ofZK177.1. The deleted regions in tm1789 and tm618 are shown above the gene. The predicted mRNA is shown below. The coding region is shaded,with the T-box emphasized. The locations of MED-1 binding sites are shown as grey circles for the RAGTATAC site deﬁned by MED-1 footprinting ofthe end-1 and end-3 promoters (Broitman-Maduro et al., 2005), and white circles for three lower-affinity RGGTATAC sites based on in vitrocompetition assays (G.B.-M., K.L., W.H. and M.M., unpublished). No additional MED sites are found elsewhere in the gene. We were unable toamplify the 5Ј end of the transcript using primers to detect SL1 or SL2, suggesting that the tbx-35 mRNA is not trans-spliced (Conrad et al., 1993);hence, the bona ﬁde 5Ј end of the transcript is not known. A polyadenylation sequence (AATAAA) is found 115 bp downstream of the predictedstop codon, but we have not conﬁrmed the precise 3Ј end of the transcript.

TBX-35 is 25-28% identical (35-39% similar) to vertebrate eomesodermin, mouse brachyury, Drosophila Dorsocross2 and itsclosest homolog in C. elegans, TBX-37.

A, E. coli BL21 was transformed with a recombinantexpression plasmid that encodes the His-tagged SEC-1 fusion proteindescribed under “Experimental Procedures” and “Results.” A controltransformation was performed with pRSET-C plasmid that lacks acDNA insert. Transformed E. coli were grown to A600 ϭ 0.6. Subse-quently, aliquots of the cultures were incubated in the presence orabsence of 1 mM IPTG. After 1 h at 37 °C, the bacteria were harvested,and E. coli proteins were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 0.1%SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel (see “Experimental Procedures”). Polypep-tides were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. Lane 1 received50 ␮g of protein from E. coli harboring the control (no cDNA insert)plasmid; lanes 2– 4 contained 50, 50, and 25 ␮g of protein, respectively,from E. coli transformed with recombinant pRSET-C that encodes theSEC-1 fusion protein (apparent Mr 25,000). Samples applied to lanes 1and 2 were obtained from uninduced E. coli; samples in lanes 3 and 4were from E. coli that were induced with 1 mM IPTG. B, The SEC-1fusion protein from IPTG-induced E. coli was dissolved and purified, vianickel chelate affinity chromatography, in buffer containing 8 M urea(see “Experimental Procedures”) and “Results”). Urea was removedfrom replicate samples of purified fusion protein by dialysis againsteither 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl or 50 mM sodiumacetate, pH 4.9. Dialyzed samples were centrifuged at 30,000 ϫ g for 10min, and supernatant and pellet fractions were collected. After boilingin SDS loading buffer, aliquots (25 ␮l) of these fractions were analyzedby denaturing electrophoresis as described above.

On the left, the amplicon con-taining the fourth exon was amplifiedwith the primers 8.11 and 8.2 and di-gested with HaeIII. Transcripts contain-ing exon 4a (970 bp) or 4c (937 bp) are notcut, whereas transcripts containing exon4b are cut in three fragments (466, 407,and 49 bp; the 49-bp band is not visible inthis image). The e189 mutation removes aHaeIII site, which is normally formed bythe splicing of exon 3 to 4b, and results inthe appearance of a larger band (arrow)and the loss of the 49-bp band (notshown). The band at 2375 bp results fromdirect PCR amplification of genomicDNA, shown in lane gwt. On the right arepresented the sequences of both wild-typeand e189 transcripts. The e189 mutationremoves the exon 4b acceptor splicingsite; a new acceptor splicing site, located22 bp upstream of the normal one, is used,introducing a stop codon. Bottom panel,analysis of the f131 mutation. On the left,the amplicon including the seventh exonwas amplified with primers 8.5 and 8.6.Transcripts containing exon 7a (983 bp)or 7b (1001 bp) are not resolved. The f131mutation in the splice donor site of exon 6provokes the apparition of a larger band(arrow). The band at 2465 bp results fromdirect PCR amplification of genomicDNA, shown in lane gwt. On the right arepresented the sequences of both wild-typeand f131 transcripts. The f131 mutationremoves the exon 6 donor splicing site;therefore, intron 6 is not spliced out andfuses to exon 7a, resulting in the introduc-tion of stop codons. The bottom band is amixture of various transcripts using cryp-tic splice sites.	TRAIN	GRAPHICS,OTHER	False	False	False	True	False	False	1	daniela		False		1

A Model for CDE-1 Activity in C. elegans(A) Schematic model of CDE-1 activity in the CSR-1 pathway, and how defective CDE-1 may affect other RNAi pathways as well. Our data strongly suggest thatCDE-1 limits the accumulation of siRNAs in the CSR-1 RNAi pathway.

A Model for CDE-1 Activity in C. elegans(A) Schematic model of CDE-1 activity in the CSR-1 pathway, and how defective CDE-1 may affect other RNAi pathways as well. Our data strongly suggest thatCDE-1 limits the accumulation of siRNAs in the CSR-1 RNAi pathway. When CDE-1 is not present, these siRNAs accumulate to high levels and may start tospread into parallel RNAi pathways mediated by different Argonaute proteins (red arrows).(B) Correlation between siRNA coverage and mRNA levels in wild-type and cde-1 mutant gonads. siRNA read numbers for each gene were normalized to the sizeof the siRNA class. The x axis shows the 2log values of the mRNA ratios in the cde-1 mutant and the wild-type, as determined by microarray analysis. Only genesthat were signiﬁcantly upregulated or signiﬁcantly downregulated (factor > 2, p < 0.05) are included. y axis shows the 2log of the ratio between the normalizedsiRNA reads in the cde-1 mutant and the reads in the wild-type library.

(A) In this predicted epi-1 nullmutant, epi-1(rh199), cell polarity is disrupted such that, in themuscles, additional dense bodies (arrows) form ectopically on thepseudocoelomic side of the cell, and sarcomeres (s′) organize in anunusual position away from the epidermis. Normally positioneddense bodies (arrowheads) and sarcomeres (s) are observed on theepidermal (e) side of the muscle cells. Dense bodies are analogous tovertebrate Z-lines and function to maintain the alignment of the thinﬁlaments. A displaced muscle cell distorts the shape of a nerve (n).(B) Strong epi-1 alleles cause sterility owing to failure ofgonadogenesis during the third larval stage. The gonadal basementmembrane is weakened or missing, and the gonadal sheath fails toenclose the germline, which permits germ cells to escape into thebody cavity and to invade neighboring tissues. In this epi-1(rh165)mutant, germ cells (asterisks) have invaded the intestine (i). Abasement membrane separates the intestine from the gonad armbelow it, however no basement membrane separates the gonad (g)and the thin layer of epidermis (e) and here the tissues adhere to oneanother (arrows). (C) In epi-1 mutants, the development of the bodywall muscles is compromised. In this epi-1(rh165) mutant, themuscle cells (m) of a quadrant show incomplete differentiation. Theorganization of the sarcomere is primitive, with poor segregation ofthick and thin ﬁlaments and little evidence of dense bodies to anchorthem. The entire muscle has failed to settle closely onto the bodywalland the intervening epidermis (e), normally a thin layer, isabnormally wide (double-headed arrows). (D) Axon migration andnerve positioning defects are often observed in epi-1 mutants. In thisepi-1(rh191) mutant, the right bundle of the ventral cord (whitearrow) is mispositioned to the dorsal side of the ventral epidermalridge (e). At the normal position of the right bundle, four or ﬁveaxons are seen (black arrow). In addition, two or three axons aremispositioned to the lateral side of the ridge (arrowheads).Interestingly, a basement membrane appears to be associated witheach of these individual axons, a phenotype never observed in wildtype.

Protein coding genes areindicated by thick arrows. (B) MSA of spike proteins (marked by “s” in panel A) from 2019-nCoV, bat coronavirus RaTG13, and Manis-CoV. Becauseonly 78% of the spike Manis-CoV sequence can be assembled, it contains several gaps in this MSA. Nevertheless, the sequence of the spike RBDdomain (solid box) can be fully assembled, where 20 residue positions (marked by arrow pairs) are diﬀerent between 2019-nCoV and the other tworelated coronaviruses.

Mean E­ C50 values in µM­(pEC50 ± S.E.M.): 2, 56 (4.3 ± 0.08); 2, 399 (3.4 ± 0.09); 5, 194 (3.7 ± 0.01) 11, 75 (4.1 ± 0.05); l-15a, 40 (4.4 ± 0.04).Mean ­Rmax values given as % of GABA ­Rmax ± S.E.M.: 2, 103 ± 3.9; 2, 76 ± 2.7; 5, 73 ± 2.8; 11, 95 ± 4.0; l-15a,36 ± 2.9. Owing to solubility limitations, a top plateau could not be obtained for 5, and the curve was thereforeconstrained to GABA ­Rmax. The fluorescence signals were hBGT1-specific, as no comparable pronouncedresponses were seen at hGAT1 stably expressed in CHO Flp-In cells, when the highest concentrations weretested (data not shown). This suggested that the fluorescence responses seen were not due to nonspecific effects,such as compound autofluorescence, and that the compounds were truly hBGT1 substrates.

(B) Effects ofKCZ (2.0 μM) on the formations of the formations of M1–M9 in mouse livermicrosomes. The relative abundance of JQ1 metabolite from the incubationin mouse liver microsomes in the absence of KCZ was set as 100%. All dataare expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 3). ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01. HLM, humanliver microsomes; MLM, mouse liver microsomes; KCZ, ketoconazole.	TRAIN	GRAPHICS,HISTOGRAM	False	False	False	False	False	False	1	arighi		False		1
