"1471-2202-7-S1-S5-3	Regulation of neuronal differentiation through miRNAs . The neural factor NF", such as a neurotrophin (BDNF, NGF) or a neurotransmitter (glutamate, serotonin), interacts with its receptor, activating a signalling cascade that switches on transcription of selected neural genes, including specific miRNA genes as well. miRNAs, in turn, can inhibit translation of proteins regulating neuronal development, for instance a neural repressor protein. Such a regulated circuit of gene expression has been recently demonstrated for neuronal morphogenesis triggered by the cAMP-response element binding protein CREB [95]. This transcriptional activator has a central role in neural specific gene expression, being implicated in many neuronal processes like differentiation, plasticity, LPT, and memory formation. miR 132, whose transcription is activated by neurotrophins and is under direct CREB control, interacts with 3'UTR of the mRNA coding for the GTPase-activating protein p250GAP.

"1478-811X-7-20-4	Calcium signaling pathways in stem cells and neural progenitor cells . Left panel represents a embryonic or adult stem cells and right panel the neuronal progenitor cells. Ca 2+  signaling depends on the increase of the intracellular Ca 2+  levels [Ca 2+ ] i ", derived from extracellular calcium (Ca 2+ ) o  sources or intracellular stores of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER Ca 2+ ). It can enter through calcium channels operated by voltage (voltage-operated Ca 2+  channels, VOCCs) in excitable cells such as neurons and muscular cells, or through calcium channels operated by receptors (receptor-operated Ca 2+  channels, ROCs) in response to neurotransmitters. SOC's (store-operated Ca 2+  channels, SOCs), open when internal Ca 2+  stores are empty, and are generally present in non-excitable cells. Calcium from the ER is released by two types of channels, Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) channels and ryanodine channels. The first is present in both neural progenitor and stem cells, while the latter is expressed only in nural progenitor cells. IP3 is generated by the action of the enzyme PLC in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). IP3 acts on receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum, promoting the release of Ca 2+  from ER stores.

Position +1 is the first position following the USS motif. The previously reported extended motif is shown above the letters.

A gap of two nucleotides has been introduced to align the  H. ducreyi  motif with the  H. influenzae  motif. (An alternative alignment places position -4 in  H. ducreyi  across from position -6 in  H. influenzae .) Examining the frequencies, we can derive a consensus pattern as follows. We mark a position with a 'w' if more than 70% of the occurrences contain an A or a T (expected frequency of an A or T = 60%). We mark a column with a 'y' or 'r' if more than 60% of the occurrences have a T or a C (for 'y') or A or a G (for 'r'). The expected frequency for either case is 50%.

A toy example of the Bayesian tree model of evolution of interactions between members of two protein families for three species:  b lue",  y ellow and  r ed. For each species a certain number of experimental datasets is given: two for blue and red and one for yellow. Part (A) shows two reconciled trees for the considered families together with putative protein interactions at each level of evolution. The proteins in the trees are represented by ellipses (with color corresponding to their species). The speciation events are marked by horizontal lines and the duplication events are marked by filled squares. The evolution of the ancestral interaction between the root proteins (purple) can be traced down the trees to the extant interactions. Evidence for the extant interactions can be found in the experimental datasets. In (B) a random variable is associated with each putative interaction. A solid arrow indicates a dependence between two random variables which comes from the speciation event. Similarly, a dashed arrow indicates a dependence for the duplication event. Finally, dotted arrows represent an interface between the true interactions in extant species and the observed experimental evidence. The parameters  p s ,  Î´ s ,  p d  and  Î´ d  determine the probability of retaining or gaining an interaction during evolution, while the reliability of each dataset ( Rel ( )) determines the probability of identifying a true interaction or a false positive one. Arrows colored blue, yellow, red and green represent messages corresponding to interaction evidence coming from each of the species. These messages are passed up the tree in the first phase of the MP algorithm. In the second phase, messages containing aggregated evidence from one side of the tree are passed down to the other side (orange arrows).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ATG at -102 bp may be the true activation site in the cat", implying an extension to exon 1 exists in the cat, 5' to  CMAH  exon 1 that has been declared in mouse  Cmah . Blood type A cats have at least one allele that creates the depicted fully functional protein. b. An 18 bp insertion is homozygous in the genomic sequence of type B cats. This insertion disrupts the reading frame created by the -102 bp ATG, causing a TGA stop codon. Approximately 50% of the mRNA of the type B cat had this insertion. c. Approximately 50% of the mRNA from the blood type B cats had the 3' portion of intron 1 spliced directly to exon 2, completely skipping exon 1, including the insertion. Two ATG sequences are present in this intronic leader but are not in frame. The first in-frame ATG occurs at bp 139 in exon 2 for cats with this mis-spliced mRNA species. The insertion and G139A mutation is concordant with the  b  allele. Cats that are blood type A but carry the  b  allele had all three species of mRNA. d. The mRNA from cats of the rare blood type AB did not extend to the -102 bp start and did not have the 18 bp insertion. The traditional ATG start at bp 1 would be the first in-frame start site. Approximately 50% of the mRNA from the blood type AB cat also had mRNA species as depicted in figure 5c but not the G139A mutation as found on the  b  allele.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cell bodies of these glial cells reside outside the MBs. The  Î± / Î² c consists of: newborn KCs (magenta bright: Glu+++), youngest KCs (pale magenta: Glu+), and mature  Î± / Î² c KCs (green: Glu-).  (A)  At the moment of eclosion and the first hour thereafter, newborn axons from the  Î± / Î² c are strongly Glu-positive (Glu+++, magenta bright). These grow down through the surrounding, and older,  Î± / Î² c neurons: older processes are shown green displaced by the youngest  Î± / Î² c axons (pale magenta). After eclosion, the only volume of the  Î± / Î²  lobe that does not have glial processes is that in which occur newborn axons of Glu-containing  Î± / Î² c neurons (bright magenta).  (B)  Twenty-four hours after eclosion, Glu expression in the core neurons has a lower intensity (pale magenta: Glu+) and at the same time delicate extensions of glial cells are seen penetrating into the  Î± / Î² c.  (C)  Ten days after eclosion: glial cells provide a mesh like network inside the  Î± / Î²  lobes and Glu immunoreactivity is no longer detectable in the core neurons. ped, pedunculus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1750-1326-6-49-10	Effect of intracerebral infusion of a Fzd receptor antagonist in GFAP response within the SNpc . The response of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was assessed by immunohistochemical (A-I) and western blot (L)analyses within the SN ipsilateral and contralateral to saline or Dkk1 infusion.  A-I :  Representative immunofluorescent images of dual staining with GFAP +  (red) and TH (green) in SN ipsilateral and contralateral to saline or Dkk1 infusion. In saline-infused SN", there was no significant difference between the ipsilateral (A) and contralateral (B) SN, whereas Dkk1 infusion induced a marked increase in astrocyte density within the ipsilateral Dkk1-infused SN, at 1 (not shown), 3 (C) and 7 (E) days post-infusion, compared to contralateral (compare with D, F). Note the increased density of hypertrophic GFAP +  astrocytes abundantly covering the ipsilateral SN of Dkk1- infused (see F and I), as compared to saline-infused SN (C), thereby indicating a time- and site-specific GFAP response to Dkk1 intranigral infusion.  J:  GFAP protein levels within the ipsi- and contralateral SN of saline and Dkk1-infused mice (n = 4/time-point) by western blot (wb), showing a marked up-regulation of GFAP in Dkk1-ipsi but not contralateral SN by 1 day post-infusion, and further increasing at 3 and 7 days post-Dkk1. By contrast, unilateral saline infusion within the right SN was without effect on GFAP protein levels. Data from the experimental bands were normalized to beta-actin, and values expressed as per cent (%) of intact uninjected controls. *p  <  0.05 ipsilateral vs contralateral, within each respective group.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conservation of position of YY1 binding sites is non-existent in olfactory genes while it is perfectly preserved in the histone 4 gene family. Directional bias in olfactory genes reflected in the figure is consistent with the complete dataset which yields 3.4 forward sites for every reverse site per 1 kb.

"1742-2094-7-9-1	The IL-18 system . Active IL-18 is produced and secreted after proteolitic cleavage of the biological inactive precursor Pro-IL-18 by caspase-1. IL-18 action can be regulated by the IL-18 binding protein (IL18-BP) that binds IL-18 with high affinity and inhibits its function. Free IL-18 binds to a specific heterodimeric cell surface receptor", a member of the IL-1 receptor/Toll like receptor superfamily comprised of two subunits, IL-18R Î±  (here referred to as IL-18R Î± I) and IL-18R Î² , both with three extracellular Ig-like domains and one intracellular portion containing the Toll/IL-1R domain (TIR). Interaction of IL-18 with the IL-18R Î±  stabilizes its interaction with IL-18R Î²  and with the adaptor protein MyD88 via the TIR domain. This initiates signal transduction by recruitment of the IL-1 receptor activating kinase (IRAK). IRAK autophosphorylates and dissociates from the receptor complex subsequently interacting with the TNFR-associated factor-6 (TRAF6) eventually leading to nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor  Îº B (NF- Îº B). Engagement of the IL-18R complex can also activate STAT3 and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38, JNK and ERK.

"1744-8069-2-32-5	Gaps in inhibition compromise glycine/GABA A  receptor-mediated modulation of firing rate only under conditions where shunting can modulate firing rate .  (A)  Whereas the time course of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) directly parallels the change in membrane conductance", the resultant inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) are much slower because of membrane capacitance. The relative brevity of IPSCs coupled with irregularity in the timing of inputs could allow gaps during which little shunting occurs (red stars).  (B)  Most  f out - f exc  curves were unchanged by switching from intermittent inhibition (dashed lines) to constant inhibition (solid lines); the exceptions were those for  E anion  = -65 and -70 mV where constant inhibition caused greater reduction in  f out  than intermittent inhibition. This argues in favor of shunting's ability to modulate firing rate only when average depolarization remains subthreshold (see Results). Constant inhibition was applied as a point conductance in the soma equal to the sum of time-averaged conductances from each inhibitory synapse, repeated at each  f inh .

"1755-1536-1-5-23	TNF-induced and ROS-dependent events in target cells: the role of JNK activation in mediating cell death. TNF interaction with its type I receptor will generate a sequence of events (depicted in Figure 23) that is not designed to lead uniquely to cell death [ 197 - 200 ] and in which ROS may play a crucial role. 1) The interaction between TNF and TNFRI is first followed by association with the intracytoplasmic receptor tail of the adapter TRADD (TNF-receptor associated death domain)", the protein kinase RIP1 and TRAF-2 and TRAF-5 (TNF-receptor associated factors 2 and 5); this works as a signalling complex that activates NF- Îº B (through Inhibitor of NF- Îº B kinase (IKK)) and MAPK cascades that regulate the AP-1 transcription factor. Activation of NF- Îº B-binding activity and transcription of dependent genes is potentially pro-survival by up-regulating the synthesis of cFLIP (c FLICE inhibitory protein), which can inhibit activation of caspase 8/10, the starting point for TNF-mediated induction of classic apoptosis. 2) At this point the TRADD/RIP-1/TRAF-2 complex can dissociates from the receptor by a still unknown mechanism and bind to FADD (Fas-ligand associated death domain) to form another complex leading to recruitment of several molecules of pro-caspase 8/10 and to their autocatalytic cleavage, resulting in activation; however, this event occurs only in cells having low levels of cFLIP, suggesting that apoptosis as well as caspase-independent or necrotic cell death (see later) may occur when the preventive pro-survival function of NF- Îº B fails. When activation of caspase 8/10 ocurs, the scenario can still prefigure two alternatives. 3) Activated caspase 8/10 may cleave the pro-apoptotic protein Bid (to tBid), which then translocates to mitochondria, causing permeabilization of mitochondrial outer membrane, cytochrome  c  release, apoptosome assembly and activation of executioner caspases, leading to classic apoptosis. This pro-apoptotic scenario may be amplified by the recruitment to TNFRI of FAN (Factor-associated neutral sphingomyelinase), which is able to produce sphingosine that, in turn, permeabilizes lysosomal membranes, leading to the release of cathepsins. These lysosomal proteases, which can be activated following engagement of different death receptors, act as pro-apoptotic proteases able to cleave Bid as well as to induce oligomerization of Bax or interact directly with mitochondrial outer membrane (note that this pathway, for the sake of clarity, has been omitted from Figure 23). It should be noted that in hepatocytes it has been reported that generation of ROS following activation of death receptors (by Fas or TNF) is strictly dependent on Bid cleavage to tBid and its subsequent translocation to mitochondria [ 201 ]. 4) The second alternative is the one more strictly related to ROS and involves the crossroads kinase RIP1. RIP1 has multiple crucial roles; it is involved in the activation of NF- Îº B, but may also contribute to apoptosis when cleaved by caspase-8 to cRIP1 (4a), an event preventing or reducing activation of NF- Îº B and sustaining enhanced interaction between TRADD, FADD and procaspases 8/10. However, it has also been described (4b) that the kinase domain of RIP1 is essential to activate JNK, which in turn (although this is just one of the JNK-dependent actions) will favour TNFRI-related apoptosis and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization by eliciting cFLIP phosphorylation and degradation. Concerning the involvement of ROS, however, RIP1 (reviewed in [ 107 ,193, 194 ]) has been shown (5) to be able also to translocate to mitochondria (prevented by NF- Îº B) following TNF stimulation of cells: this event induces mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and increases release of ROS in the cytoplasm without leading to cytochrome  c  release and apoptosome complex formation. This increased TNF-related mitochondrial generation of ROS is crucial because it can lead target cells to apoptosis or, more likely, to a necrotic or caspase-independent form of cell death: in this latter scenario a significant role is attributed to ROS-mediated sustained activation of JNK (6), surely operating in hepatocytes [ 186 , 187 ], which, as we will see (Figure 24), is a crucial crossroads for ROS-related irreversible injury of parenchymal cells as elicited by the different aetiologies leading to CLDs. TNF (7) may lead to ROS-dependent and JNK-mediated cell death (necrotic type) also by involving activation of Nox1: however, this mechanism has been described in fibroblasts and, at present, we do not know whether it may apply to hepatocytes or other liver cell populations [ 195 , 202 ].,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"1746-4811-5-2-2	Quenching of HRP-generated light output by an antioxidant .  A:  Light generation of the HRP-catalysed luminol reaction was triggered by the addition of H 2 O 2  (at time t 0  = -36 s). The reaction is quenched by the addition of an antioxidant when a constant output signal is established. Here Trolox   (( Â± )-6-Hydroxy-2",5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid) a water soluble derivative of tocopherol (vitamin E) was used. The antioxidant is oxidised by H 2 O 2  thus inhibiting the HRP-catalysed reaction. When the antioxidant is depleted, the HRP reaction resumes and the light signal recovers.  B : The time point of signal recovery t r  depends on the amount of added antioxidant and is defined here as the time where the rate of signal increase is maximum.

The stages chosen for gap gene analysis were earlier than those for pair rule genes because, unlike pair rule mRNA, gap mRNA is rapidly down-regulated towards the end of stage 5, whereas pair rule expression increases throughout stage 5. The error boxes at each measurement point represent 95% confidence intervals for the mean in a/p and d/v directions. Anterior is to the left, dorsal is to the top. The x- and y-axes show the distance in  Î¼ m from the center of embryo mass. It can be seen that most stripe borders changed spatial location during stage 5. The silhouettes of PointClouds were smaller for later stage embryos because of basal nuclear movements. Note that, for each  eve  and  ftz  stripe, the posterior stripe border shows a broadly similar movement to the anterior border, indicating that the movements observed are not principally due to the narrowing of stripes (data not shown).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"gb-2010-11-8-216-3	Possible mechanisms for dosage compensation .  (a)  The twofold activation of the single male X chromosome in  Drosophila  could be achieved by a large", MOF-dependent activation of transcription through H4K16 acetylation and its counteraction by yet unknown factors, mediated by the dosage-compensation complex in males [ 51 ]. In (a,b), transcriptional level 1 refers to the normal regulated level of transcription from a single uncompensated X chromosome in females.  (b)  Furthermore, the twofold activation of the male X chromosome could be achieved by a combination of mechanisms: a general buffering/feedback component and a dedicated feed-forward mechanism (dosage compensation as suggested in (a)) [ 7 ]. The effects of these two processes could add up to the expected twofold compensation required to equalize the express ion of X-linked genes between the sexes.  (c)  Precise transcription levels could result from negotiation between a number of activating and repressive factors (up and down arrows). In this instance, transcriptional level 1 refers to a 'basal' transcription state. This hypothetical model assumes that additional factors beyond those mentioned in (a) and (b) contribute to final transcription levels, such as male-enriched protein kinases, heterochromatin components, chromatin remodelers, and others (for details, see text).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"1756-0500-4-457-2	Primer-dimers and UNG degradation products can inhibit PCR amplification . a) The negative control reactions (water and PCR reagents", but no DNA) from the mouse mitochondrial DNA PCR and the PSMA transgene PCR were diluted from 10 -2  to 10 -5 . Both sets of dilutions were used to contaminate a PCR for the PSMA transgene. All reactions were amplified with the ABI Gene Expression Master-mix (containing UNG). b) The same experiment was conducted except the NEB Taq Polymerase and buffer was used (no UNG in the PCR for both generation of the primer-dimers and subsequent PCR). NEB Taq is less efficient than ABI Taq at amplifying the target for the lower band in the PSMA transgene PCR, however inhibition by contaminating primer-dimers is the same regardless of PCR mix. c) The PSMA transgene PCR product and negative control were amplified with the ABI Gene Expression Master-mix and gel purified to remove primer-dimers. These products as well as non-purified PSMA transgene PCR product and negative control (that contain primer-dimers) were used to contaminate a subsequent PSMA transgene PCR. The results indicate that amplification of legitimate PCR target is significantly inhibited by contamination with previously generated negative control reactions using the same primers, regardless of the presence or absence of UNG. It also indicates that the UNG degradation products can weakly inhibit amplification and the UNG degradation products and primer-dimers can completely inhibit PCR amplification.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"1476-4598-10-26-2	EGFRvIII translocates into mitochondria even under unstressed condition but the transport is enhanced by apoptosis inducers and EGFR inhibition . Since endogenous EGFRvIII expression is not maintained  in vitro  [ 28 ]", we used U87MG-EGFRvIII stable transfectant cells expressing EGFRvIII [ 12 ] in these studies.  A , Full-length EGFRvIII is present in the mitochondria under unstressed condition and the level is enhanced by apoptotic stress and Iressa. Cancer cells treated with and without 1 uM staurosporine (ST) and 100 ng/ml anisomycin (AN) for 15 min were fractionated into mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial fractions followed by western blotting. Full-length EGFRvIII was detected in both extracts. The mtEGFRvIII indices indicate that staurosporine and anisomycin increased the levels of mitochondrial EGFRvIII by approximately 3-4 folds.  B , Iressa induces significant mitochondrial transport of EGFRvIII. Cancer cells were treated with and without 12.5 uM Iressa, an EGFR kinase inhibitor, for 15 min and subjected to cell fractionation and western blotting. Effectiveness of cell fractionation was indicated by the lack of the cytoplasmic marker  Î² -actin and a nuclear protein lamin B in the mitochondrial extracts, as well as, by the absence of the mitochondrial protein Cox IV in the non-mitochondrial extracts. The mtEGFRvIII indices indicate that Iressa resulted in a marked increase (7.5-fold) of mitochondrial EGFRvIII.  C , Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy confirmed staurosporine-, anisomycin and Iressa-induced EGFRvIII mitochondrial import. In these studies, we used an EGFR antibody that recognized the N-terminal epitope in EGFRvIII and the Myc antibody that bound to the C-terminal Myc-tag of the EGFRvIII fusion protein (data not shown) and found both antibodies to detect mitochondrial EGFRvIII. This observation and the molecular weight shown in western blotting suggest that the mitochondrially localized EGFRvIII is highly likely to be the full-length protein.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Counts-per-second of bioluminescence are plotted on the vertical axis with time in hours given on the horizontal axis. The shaded region around the mean activity line indicates standard error of the mean (SEM). The column labeled 'normalized data' shows plots of the averaged detrended and normalized data as described under Figure  1  (also see Materials and Methods and [ 27 ]). The shaded region represents the SEM. Units on the ordinate are arbitrary and the plot is centered around a mean of 1. Time (in hours) is represented on the abcissa. The column labeled 'autocorrelation' shows correlograms for the normalized data. Correlation coefficients are plotted on the ordinate with a range of values from -1 to 1. The gray region centered around 0 describes a 95% confidence interval. The lag of the autocorrelation function is plotted on the abcissa. An asterisk is placed above the third peak of the autocorrelation function. The value at that point defines the Rhythmicity Index (RI), an estimate of the strength of rhythmicity [ 27 , 31 ]. When the asterisk is not present, the autocorrelation function indicates a lack of rhythmicity. Values for the RI appear in the lower left corner of these plots along with a related number called the Rhythmicity Statistic (RS). The RS value is the ratio of the RI to the absolute value of the confidence line. This metric indicates that the rhythmicity described by the correlogram is statistically significant when the value is    1 (see Materials and Methods for more detail). The column labeled 'mesa' shows a spectral analysis of the data that provides an estimate of the period [ 37 , 27 ]. Spectral density is given in arbitrary units on the ordinate and the range of periods we assess is shown on the abcissa. Asterisks are placed over the highest peak shown in a range between 18 ¨¹ 30 hours. Although we take this value as the estimate of circadian period, there may be other periodicities present within the horizontal range (the width) of the peak or elsewhere on the plot and these additional rhythmic components are also present in the data. Absence of an asterisk indicates either the absence of a peak or that any peak within the plot occurs outside the circadian range. Note that the autocorrelation plot is used to determine rhythmicity and mesa is used to provide an estimate of the period only when warranted by correlogram (for more details see Materials and Methods and [ 27 ]). a.) averaged data for  cry +  or  cry b  antennal pairs.
