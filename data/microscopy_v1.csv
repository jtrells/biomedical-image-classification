Panel A: Induction of BnDGAT1 (1 ï¿½ï¿½ 116) His 6  expression in bacteria monitored by SDS-PAGE. From left to right: molecular mass markers (lane 1), clarified lysate from non-induced bacteria (lane 2), clarified lysate from two independent incubations of bacteria treated with IPTG (lanes 3 and 4), pellet obtained from clarified lysate of bacteria induced with IPTG (lane 5). Experiments to demonstrate induction of BnDGAT1 (1 ï¿½ï¿½ 116) His 6  synthesis were conducted using an incubation medium of 5 ml (instead of the 500 mL used for preparative work). Harvested  E. coli  were resuspended in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mM NaCl. The suspension was passed through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. three times and the ruptured bacteria were centrifuged at 13,000  g  for 15 min to obtain a clarified lysate. The 13,000  g  pellet obtained from ruptured bacteria that had been induced with IPTG was resuspended in extraction buffer. Equal volumes of each sample were applied to the SDS gel. Panel B: Analysis by SDS-PAGE of BnDGAT1 (1 ï¿½ï¿½ 116) His 6  purified by immobilized nickel ion chromatography. From left to right: molecular mass markers (lane 1), pass-through fraction (lane 2), fraction eluted with equilibration buffer (lane 3), and fractions eluted with 4 ml portions of equilibration buffer containing 40, 60 and 80 mM imidazole, respectively (lanes 4 ï¿½ï¿½ 6). The protein load for lane 4 was about 10  Î¼ g. Ten microliter aliquots of each of the eluents were applied to the gel. Panel C: MALDI-TOF spectrum of BnDGAT1 (1 ï¿½ï¿½ 116) His 6 . The spectrum was acquired using a Voyager DE-Pro TOF MS (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA, USA) using a 2-layer spotting technique. Matrix layer 1 was approximately 15 mg/mL  Î± -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid dissolved in 1:2 (v/v) methanol:acetone. Matrix layer 2 was saturated  Î± -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 1:2 (v/v) methanol/water. One microliter of layer 1 solution was spotted and allowed to dry. Protein sample (450  Î¼ g/mL) was mixed with layer 2 solution in a ratio between 1:1 and 1:4 (sample:matrix). One microliter of layer 2 solution was spotted on the dried layer 1 spot, and allowed to dry. The dried spot was washed 2 ï¿½ï¿½ 3 times with a drop of cold distilled water to remove salts prior to analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Panel D: Microcrystals of BnDGAT1 (1 ï¿½ï¿½ 116) His 6 . To begin preparation of microcrystals, a 12 mg/mL solution of BnDGAT1 (1 ï¿½ï¿½ 116) His 6  was dialyzed against 10 mM glycine-NaOH (pH 9.0) containing 20 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA. Initial screening for crystallization conditions using vapor diffusion and hanging drops resulted in several instances of microcrystals, which grew as plates, within 1 ï¿½ï¿½ 2 weeks. Microcrystals were obtained from ammonium sulfate and ammonium phosphate solutions over a wide pH range.	TRAIN	DMEL

Figures 13 A-D are representative photomicrographs obtained 24 hours after bladder instillation of BCG-GFP (1.5    10 7  CFU) into the bladder of anesthetized mice (see material and methods) and Figures 13 G-J are high magnifications of the same area depicted in Figures A-D.  Figures 13 A and 13 G are DAPI [4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole] that was used to highlight the nucleus. Figures 13B and 13H were stained with LRG-47. Figures 13C and 13I indicate the presence of BCG in the urothelium as indicated by the fluorescence of GFP in two major areas delimited by white circles. Figures 13D and 13J are merged photograph indicating that BCG-GFP is co-localized in vesicles positives for LRG-47 (yellow). White arrows in Figures 13 A-D point to GFP and rhodamine signals that are co-localized in the merge picture (Figure 13D). Next, pictures 13B and 13C were submitted to image analysis by the Interactive 3D Surface Plot [90] , a plug-in for ImageJ software [23]. Figure 13E represents the Integrative 3D surface that translates the luminance of the images in Figure 13 B-C as height for the plot using the nearest neighbor sampling. For co-localization of BCG-GFP and LRG47-Rhodamine, pictures were converted to 8-bit gray scale images (fluorescence intensity range: 0  <  255) using Image J software [23] and the analysis was performed with the co-localization-finder plug-in [24] . The results presented in Figure 13F were electronically generated by the software resulting in a merged picture with white areas indicating the co-localization between BCG and LRG-47-positive vesicles and the Pearson's_correlation and overlap coefficient are provided. These results indicate that instillation of BCG-GFP into the mouse bladder, in the conditions described in this manuscript, does not result in urothelial injury and microscopic extravasation of BCG or cause artifacts, including forcing bacteria into the urothelium.

(a)  2PA spectra of tagRFP (red circles) and mKalama1 (blue squares) and the fluorescence emission spectra of tagRFP (red line) and mKalama1(blue line). The y-axis represents the cross section (GM). The top x-axis represents the transition wavelength and the bottom x-axis represents the laser wavelength used for excitation. The different transitions of each FP chromophore are marked with arrows. Fluorescence emission spectra are shown in arbitrary units.  (b)  Jablonski diagram showing the electronic transitions that tagRFP and mKalama1 experience upon excitation with 760 nm light.  (c)  To test this approach we mixed HEK293 cells expressing either tagRFP or mKalama1 and imaged them with 780 nm excitation. (d) Scatter plot graphing red vs. blue pixel intensity of the image found in  (a) . With the settings used, none of the red signal is picked up by the blue detector. However, because of the broad red-shoulder in the mKalama1 emission spectrum (Figure 2) a small amount of the signal in the red detector is due to blue emission, as indicated by the slight linear slope found in the blue cells.

Paraffin-embedded fixed sections of skin from  Involucrin-c-MycER TAM  mice were examined histologically by H & E staining. In the absence of 4-OHT (inactive c-Myc) the epidermis shows normal histology ( Normal ). Activation of c-Myc in skin treated topically with 4-OHT daily for 14 days induced hyperplasia, dysplasia and angiogenesis within papillomatous lesions ( c-Myc on ).

The overview in A shows a well-preserved type II cell from a newborn rat lung fixed by instillation of 1.5% GA, 1.5% PFA in Hepes buffer and processed according to Table 1. Lamellar bodies (LB), nucleus (Nu) and mitochondria (Mt) are well preserved. At a higher magnification, details of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as well as an ER related multivesicular transport vesicle (MvTV) can be visualized. The overview in C shows a well-preserved type II cell from an adult rat lung. A small piece of tissue was cut from the whole lung, put in a syringe with 1-hexadecene and air was extracted from the tissue block by negative pressure. Afterwards, the specimen was high-pressure frozen (Leica EMPact 2.0, Leica, Vienna, Austria), freeze-substituted with acetone containing 1% osmium tetroxide (AFS 2.0, Leica, Vienna, Austria) and embedded in epoxy resin. Most likely due to the lack of uranyl acetate during freeze-substitution the lamellar bodies are not well preserved, with almost complete loss of the surfactant material, only the limiting membrane can be seen. However, the ultrastructure of other organelles like multivesicular bodies (MvB) is highly increased (D) due to the excellent preservation of the membrane structures (Me).

After 2 days in culture, cadherin-11-expressing L-cells condensed and accumulated at the FN ¨¹ BSA interphase to form a lining layer-like structure. In contrast, vector control L-cells were randomly distributed at the FN-coated area and did not form a lining layer.

Confocal laser scanning micrographs were taken from serial horizontal sections through the dorsal  (A)  and the ventral hippocampus  (G)  that were immunostained for NeuN to detect the nuclei of neuronal cells. To quantify cytoarchitectural variations in the structure of neuronal cell layers, the numbers of neighbours for any given cell were determined as a measure of density of cell packing. In the dorsal hippocampus of WT animals (n = 6), fewer cells were surrounded by a high number of neighbours, i.e. neurons showed a more sparse pattern  (C-F) . By contrast, in  Ctsk -/-  mice (n = 6) the ventral part of the hippocampus showed a significantly more sparse neuronal distribution  (G-L) . This patterning difference was most pronounced in the DG  (C and I) , CA2  (E and K)  and CA1  (F and L) , although all regions exhibited significant differences in the patterning of the neuronal layer between the two genotypes (p  <  0.001, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).  (B)  Numbers of neurons were increased in DG, CA3 and CA2 regions in the dorsal part of the hippocampus of  Ctsk -/-  compared to WT mice, whereas neuronal numbers were decreased in the CA1 region of  Ctsk -/-  mice.  (H)  Fewer neurons were observed in DG and CA1 region in the ventral area of the hippocampus of  Ctsk -/-  mice. Bars - 200  Î¼ m  (A, G) .

(A) The downstream proteins levels of the CSL-independent Notch pathway (DTX1 and Ep300) were significantly increased in the PLC/PRF/5 spheres, compared with the parental cell line. GAPDH was used as a loading control. (B) 10  Î¼ M MRK003 could reduce the activation of Notch1 and downstream components of CSL-independent Notch signaling pathway DTX1 and Ep300 were consequently decreased. (C) The secondary dissociated PLC/PRF/5 sphere-forming cells were treated with 10  Î¼ M MRK003 or DMSO control for 7 days. The sphere formation ability of the MRK003-treated groups were significantly inhibited in comparison to DMSO-treated controls.	TEST	DMLI

Publications were collected from the official publication lists of the following centers: Berkeley Center for Structural Genomics (BSGC), Center for Eukaroytic Structural Genomics (CESG), Joint Center for Structural Genomics (JCSG), Midwest Consortium for Structural Genomics (MCSG), Northeast Structural Genomics (NESG) consortium, New York Structural Genomics Research Consortium (NYSGXRC), Southeast Consortium for Structural Genomics (SECSG), Structural Genomics of Pathogenic Protozoa (SGPP), and Tuberculosis Structural Genomics (TB) consortium. The MCSG, NESG, and NYSGXRC consortia have comparably greater authorship of publications, with individual laboratories clustering together. The BSGC and JCSG centers include nearly all participating authors on every publication, as seen by dense clusters with heavy edge weights. At the other extreme, the TB consortium is a loose collaboration of many groups of different scientists who tend to publish separately.	TEST	DMLI

Confocal laser scanning micrographs were taken from serial horizontal sections through the dorsal  (A)  and the ventral hippocampus  (G)  that were immunostained for NeuN to detect the nuclei of neuronal cells. To quantify cytoarchitectural variations in the structure of neuronal cell layers, the numbers of neighbours for any given cell were determined as a measure of density of cell packing. In the dorsal hippocampus of WT animals (n = 6), fewer cells were surrounded by a high number of neighbours, i.e. neurons showed a more sparse pattern  (C-F) . By contrast, in  Ctsk -/-  mice (n = 6) the ventral part of the hippocampus showed a significantly more sparse neuronal distribution  (G-L) . This patterning difference was most pronounced in the DG  (C and I) , CA2  (E and K)  and CA1  (F and L) , although all regions exhibited significant differences in the patterning of the neuronal layer between the two genotypes (p  <  0.001, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).
