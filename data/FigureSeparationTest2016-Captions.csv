"1744-8069-2-32-5	Gaps in inhibition compromise glycine/GABA A  receptor-mediated modulation of firing rate only under conditions where shunting can modulate firing rate .  (A)  Whereas the time course of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) directly parallels the change in membrane conductance", the resultant inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) are much slower because of membrane capacitance. The relative brevity of IPSCs coupled with irregularity in the timing of inputs could allow gaps during which little shunting occurs (red stars).  (B)  Most  f out - f exc  curves were unchanged by switching from intermittent inhibition (dashed lines) to constant inhibition (solid lines); the exceptions were those for  E anion  = -65 and -70 mV where constant inhibition caused greater reduction in  f out  than intermittent inhibition. This argues in favor of shunting's ability to modulate firing rate only when average depolarization remains subthreshold (see Results). Constant inhibition was applied as a point conductance in the soma equal to the sum of time-averaged conductances from each inhibitory synapse, repeated at each  f inh .

The column labeled 'raw data' shows the average plots of luciferase activity for the rhythmic subset of samples as given in Table  1  or Table  2 ", respectively. Counts-per-second of bioluminescence are plotted on the vertical axis with time in hours given on the horizontal axis. The shaded region around the mean activity line indicates standard error of the mean (SEM). The column labeled 'normalized data' shows plots of the averaged detrended and normalized data as described under Figure  1  (also see Materials and Methods and [ 27 ]). The shaded region represents the SEM. Units on the ordinate are arbitrary and the plot is centered around a mean of 1. Time (in hours) is represented on the abcissa. The column labeled 'autocorrelation' shows correlograms for the normalized data. Correlation coefficients are plotted on the ordinate with a range of values from -1 to 1. The gray region centered around 0 describes a 95% confidence interval. The lag of the autocorrelation function is plotted on the abcissa. An asterisk is placed above the third peak of the autocorrelation function. The value at that point defines the Rhythmicity Index (RI), an estimate of the strength of rhythmicity [ 27 , 31 ]. When the asterisk is not present, the autocorrelation function indicates a lack of rhythmicity. Values for the RI appear in the lower left corner of these plots along with a related number called the Rhythmicity Statistic (RS). The RS value is the ratio of the RI to the absolute value of the confidence line. This metric indicates that the rhythmicity described by the correlogram is statistically significant when the value is    1 (see Materials and Methods for more detail). The column labeled 'mesa' shows a spectral analysis of the data that provides an estimate of the period [ 37 , 27 ]. Spectral density is given in arbitrary units on the ordinate and the range of periods we assess is shown on the abcissa. Asterisks are placed over the highest peak shown in a range between 18 ¨¹ 30 hours. Although we take this value as the estimate of circadian period, there may be other periodicities present within the horizontal range (the width) of the peak or elsewhere on the plot and these additional rhythmic components are also present in the data. Absence of an asterisk indicates either the absence of a peak or that any peak within the plot occurs outside the circadian range.

Ca 2+  signaling depends on the increase of the intracellular Ca 2+  levels [Ca 2+ ] i ", derived from extracellular calcium (Ca 2+ ) o  sources or intracellular stores of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER Ca 2+ ). It can enter through calcium channels operated by voltage (voltage-operated Ca 2+  channels, VOCCs) in excitable cells such as neurons and muscular cells, or through calcium channels operated by receptors (receptor-operated Ca 2+  channels, ROCs) in response to neurotransmitters. SOC's (store-operated Ca 2+  channels, SOCs), open when internal Ca 2+  stores are empty, and are generally present in non-excitable cells. Calcium from the ER is released by two types of channels, Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) channels and ryanodine channels. The first is present in both neural progenitor and stem cells, while the latter is expressed only in nural progenitor cells. IP3 is generated by the action of the enzyme PLC in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). IP3 acts on receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum, promoting the release of Ca 2+  from ER stores.

Position +1 is the first position following the USS motif. The previously reported extended motif is shown above the letters.  (b)  A sequence logo created from the regions surrounding occurrences of the conjectured USS motif in  H. ducreyi . A gap of two nucleotides has been introduced to align the  H. ducreyi  motif with the  H. influenzae  motif. (An alternative alignment places position -4 in  H. ducreyi  across from position -6 in  H. influenzae .) Examining the frequencies, we can derive a consensus pattern as follows. We mark a position with a 'w' if more than 70% of the occurrences contain an A or a T (expected frequency of an A or T = 60%). We mark a column with a 'y' or 'r' if more than 60% of the occurrences have a T or a C (for 'y') or A or a G (for 'r'). The expected frequency for either case is 50%. The 'rwwwwnnnn' from positions +2 to +11 matches the previously identified extended motif for  H. influenzae , though the rwwww motif is not as clear. The subsequent 'nnrwwwww' from the extended  H. influenzae  motif is not exactly matched in  H. ducreyi  but there is a general bias toward A and T residues extending to about +25.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mean number of infectious bites per mosquito and the lifetime mean number of salivary gland sporozoites available to be injected per mosquito are both estimated assuming the mosquito is infected at its first bloodmeal. Parasite-induced vector mortality is dependent on the number of oocysts at day 10 (A, B, E and F) or salivary gland sporozoites on day 21 (C, D, G and H). In panels A, C, E and G the model was run with either no intervention (black line) or representing an intervention which reduced the production of a life-stage by 60%: gametocytes (yellow line); ookinetes (blue line); oocysts (green line); salivary gland sporozoites (red line). Note that the black and red lines overrun each other in panel A. The thin grey dotted-dashed line indicates an overall efficacy of 60% for comparison. The contour plots (panels B, D, F and H) show the relationship between gametocytaemia, the efficacy of an intervention which targeting oocysts and the overall reduction in transmission that this intervention causes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"1471-2199-5-9-5	Efficient target gene silencing with reduced OAS1 induction and lower shRNA expression.  Total RNA was isolated from IS-1 cells (CTRL) or IS-1 cells 4 days after transduction with U6PT", sh319 or sh321 vectors. After reverse transcription, cDNA was analysed for expression of PAI-2 (A) and OAS1 (B). Data were generated by QRT-PCR, each target gene was detected in triplicate, error bars represent the standard deviation of mean values. 1 ml or 0.1 ml of each lentiviral vector stock was used, hence the designations 1 and 0.1. Vector titres were approximately 10 6  transducing units per ml resulting in a multiplicity of transduction of approximately 10 for 1 ml used or 1 for 0.1 ml used. In C, shRNA expression was detected in total cell RNAs using a modified RNase protection protocol. Total RNA was mixed with radiolabelled probes for hybridization and RNase protection. Samples were resolved on a 15 % Acrylamide/8M Urea/TBE gel and RNase protected probes detected by autoradiography. Lane 1 shows the Mir-16 probe without RNase digestion or target RNA, lane 2 is as lane 1 with RNase digestion and lane 3 as lane 2 with U6PT-transduced cell RNA as hybridization target. Lane 4 shows the sh3 probe without RNase digestion or target RNA, lane 5 as lane 4 with RNase digestion and lane 6 as lane 5 with U6PT-transduced cell RNA as hybridization target. In lane 7 sh321-transduced cell RNA was used as the hybridization target for the sh3 probe with RNase digestion, and lane 8 is as lane 7 except that cells were transduced with 10-fold less vector titre (sh321 1 and sh321 0.1).

"1756-0500-4-457-2	Primer-dimers and UNG degradation products can inhibit PCR amplification . a) The negative control reactions (water and PCR reagents", but no DNA) from the mouse mitochondrial DNA PCR and the PSMA transgene PCR were diluted from 10 -2  to 10 -5 . Both sets of dilutions were used to contaminate a PCR for the PSMA transgene. All reactions were amplified with the ABI Gene Expression Master-mix (containing UNG). b) The same experiment was conducted except the NEB Taq Polymerase and buffer was used (no UNG in the PCR for both generation of the primer-dimers and subsequent PCR). NEB Taq is less efficient than ABI Taq at amplifying the target for the lower band in the PSMA transgene PCR, however inhibition by contaminating primer-dimers is the same regardless of PCR mix. c) The PSMA transgene PCR product and negative control were amplified with the ABI Gene Expression Master-mix and gel purified to remove primer-dimers. These products as well as non-purified PSMA transgene PCR product and negative control (that contain primer-dimers) were used to contaminate a subsequent PSMA transgene PCR. The results indicate that amplification of legitimate PCR target is significantly inhibited by contamination with previously generated negative control reactions using the same primers, regardless of the presence or absence of UNG. It also indicates that the UNG degradation products can weakly inhibit amplification and the UNG degradation products and primer-dimers can completely inhibit PCR amplification.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blood type A cats have at least one allele that creates the depicted fully functional protein. b. An 18 bp insertion is homozygous in the genomic sequence of type B cats. This insertion disrupts the reading frame created by the -102 bp ATG, causing a TGA stop codon. Approximately 50% of the mRNA of the type B cat had this insertion. c. Approximately 50% of the mRNA from the blood type B cats had the 3' portion of intron 1 spliced directly to exon 2, completely skipping exon 1, including the insertion. Two ATG sequences are present in this intronic leader but are not in frame. The first in-frame ATG occurs at bp 139 in exon 2 for cats with this mis-spliced mRNA species.

"1471-213X-7-47-5	A mutually repressive network with an additional element . (A) The homeobox-containing transcription factor Xom mediates the repression of  Gsc  by Xbra. The gene network can be abstracted into a general network consisting of M", A, B and C as illustrated. (B) Ordinary differential equations describing the dynamics of the network in (A). k a , k b  and k c  are respectively the rates of synthesis of A, B and C.  Î±  and  Î³  are the cooperativities of repression by A and C,  Îµ  and  Î¼  are the cooperativities of induction by B and M, respectively. kd a , kd b  and kd c  are the decay rate constants. The dynamics of A and B are similar to those in Additional file  1  and show bistability. (C) Simulations were performed with k a  = k b  = 5 and  Î±  =  Î³  = 3 ( Î¼  = 1, kd a  = kd b  = kd c  = 1). Threshold values of M, which are colour-coded, are plotted in the parameter plane (k c ,  Îµ ). k c  and  Îµ  determine how the value of C changes over time. There are two areas in the parameter plane where the system is bistable with a threshold. With smaller values of k c  and  Îµ  (area 1), B is on and A is off with low M, and vice versa with high M at steady state. With larger values of k c  and  Îµ  (area 2), A is on and B is off with low M, and vice versa with high M at steady state. (D) Typical examples (black dots in (C)) of steady state values of A and B plotted against M. Left panel, (k c ,  Îµ ) = (4, 2.5). Right panel, (k c ,  Îµ ) = (12, 9). If smaller values of k c  and  Îµ  are favoured in nature, the above observation may explain why at steady state and with low activin Xbra (which corresponds to B) is on and Gsc (which corresponds to A) is off, and vice versa with high activin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"gb-2010-11-8-216-3	Possible mechanisms for dosage compensation .  (a)  The twofold activation of the single male X chromosome in  Drosophila  could be achieved by a large", MOF-dependent activation of transcription through H4K16 acetylation and its counteraction by yet unknown factors, mediated by the dosage-compensation complex in males [ 51 ]. In (a,b), transcriptional level 1 refers to the normal regulated level of transcription from a single uncompensated X chromosome in females.  (b)  Furthermore, the twofold activation of the male X chromosome could be achieved by a combination of mechanisms: a general buffering/feedback component and a dedicated feed-forward mechanism (dosage compensation as suggested in (a)) [ 7 ]. The effects of these two processes could add up to the expected twofold compensation required to equalize the express ion of X-linked genes between the sexes.  (c)  Precise transcription levels could result from negotiation between a number of activating and repressive factors (up and down arrows). In this instance, transcriptional level 1 refers to a 'basal' transcription state. This hypothetical model assumes that additional factors beyond those mentioned in (a) and (b) contribute to final transcription levels, such as male-enriched protein kinases, heterochromatin components, chromatin remodelers, and others (for details, see text).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(b) For IL-13 the order of the binding events is reversed. IL-13 binds first to the IL-13R Î± 1 subunit; the affinity of IL-13 to IL-4R Î±  is below detection limit (app.  K D  >  100  Î¼ M). In the second step the IL-13:IL-13R Î± 1 complex recruits the IL-4R Î±  subunit into the complex. Values marked  K D * indicate that these interactions are measured by binding of the soluble ectodomain to the surface immobilized binary complex of ligand and high-affinity receptor subunits. These apparent binding constants do not reflect the real affinity for a two-dimensional interaction in the membrane. (c, d) The location of the binding sites for the receptor subunits IL-4R Î±  and IL-13R Î± 1 are conserved between the two cytokines IL-4 (c) and IL-13 (d).

To quantify cytoarchitectural variations in the structure of neuronal cell layers", the numbers of neighbours for any given cell were determined as a measure of density of cell packing. In the dorsal hippocampus of WT animals (n = 6), fewer cells were surrounded by a high number of neighbours, i.e. neurons showed a more sparse pattern  (C-F) . By contrast, in  Ctsk -/-  mice (n = 6) the ventral part of the hippocampus showed a significantly more sparse neuronal distribution  (G-L) . This patterning difference was most pronounced in the DG  (C and I) , CA2  (E and K)  and CA1  (F and L) , although all regions exhibited significant differences in the patterning of the neuronal layer between the two genotypes (p  <  0.001, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).

For each species a certain number of experimental datasets is given: two for blue and red and one for yellow. Part (A) shows two reconciled trees for the considered families together with putative protein interactions at each level of evolution. The proteins in the trees are represented by ellipses (with color corresponding to their species). The speciation events are marked by horizontal lines and the duplication events are marked by filled squares. The evolution of the ancestral interaction between the root proteins (purple) can be traced down the trees to the extant interactions. Evidence for the extant interactions can be found in the experimental datasets. In (B) a random variable is associated with each putative interaction. A solid arrow indicates a dependence between two random variables which comes from the speciation event. Similarly, a dashed arrow indicates a dependence for the duplication event. Finally, dotted arrows represent an interface between the true interactions in extant species and the observed experimental evidence. The parameters  p s ,  Î´ s ,  p d  and  Î´ d  determine the probability of retaining or gaining an interaction during evolution, while the reliability of each dataset ( Rel ( )) determines the probability of identifying a true interaction or a false positive one. Arrows colored blue, yellow, red and green represent messages corresponding to interaction evidence coming from each of the species. These messages are passed up the tree in the first phase of the MP algorithm. In the second phase, messages containing aggregated evidence from one side of the tree are passed down to the other side (orange arrows).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The stages chosen for gap gene analysis were earlier than those for pair rule genes because, unlike pair rule mRNA, gap mRNA is rapidly down-regulated towards the end of stage 5, whereas pair rule expression increases throughout stage 5. The error boxes at each measurement point represent 95% confidence intervals for the mean in a/p and d/v directions. Anterior is to the left, dorsal is to the top. The x- and y-axes show the distance in  Î¼ m from the center of embryo mass. It can be seen that most stripe borders changed spatial location during stage 5. The silhouettes of PointClouds were smaller for later stage embryos because of basal nuclear movements. Note that, for each  eve  and  ftz  stripe, the posterior stripe border shows a broadly similar movement to the anterior border, indicating that the movements observed are not principally due to the narrowing of stripes (data not shown).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The  Î± / Î²  lobe is the last born domain of the MB", formed during pupation. This lobe is entirely covered by glial cell processes that express Glu signaling molecules (dEAAT1, GS). The cell bodies of these glial cells reside outside the MBs. The  Î± / Î² c consists of: newborn KCs (magenta bright: Glu+++), youngest KCs (pale magenta: Glu+), and mature  Î± / Î² c KCs (green: Glu-).  (A)  At the moment of eclosion and the first hour thereafter, newborn axons from the  Î± / Î² c are strongly Glu-positive (Glu+++, magenta bright). These grow down through the surrounding, and older,  Î± / Î² c neurons: older processes are shown green displaced by the youngest  Î± / Î² c axons (pale magenta). After eclosion, the only volume of the  Î± / Î²  lobe that does not have glial processes is that in which occur newborn axons of Glu-containing  Î± / Î² c neurons (bright magenta).  (B)  Twenty-four hours after eclosion, Glu expression in the core neurons has a lower intensity (pale magenta: Glu+) and at the same time delicate extensions of glial cells are seen penetrating into the  Î± / Î² c.
