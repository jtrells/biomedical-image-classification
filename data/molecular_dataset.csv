Panel A: schematic of two locations from the 18th draft of the human genome declared in the system to have some overlap, with Genomic Location 1 overlapping the 5' end of Genomic Location 2. This relationship can be specified in terms of relationships between corresponding pairs of Attributes of those Locations. Panel B: We make the types of relationships we wish to query explicit, and can now allow us to perform queries based on Locations. For example,"" we define here a set of 5 rules that specify a relationship of """"Location 1 overlaps the 5'-end of Location 2"""" that holds between Locations in the 18th draft of the human genome (specified by the """"Context"""" and """"Target Context"""" columns). Other ruleforms (not shown) contain meta-rules that ensure the appropriate rules are chosen for a given scenario. In this case"","" the rules for determining a 5' overlap depend on what nucleic acid strand (forward or reverse) a given genomic region lies; here we show the rules that apply for the forward strand only. These rules specify what relationships must hold between attributes of our query Location (""""Location 1 Attribute"""" consideration) and those of any other Location (""""Location 2 Attribute"""" consideration) whose 5' region is overlapped by our query Location. For instance"", the first rule states that both Locations must be on the same sequence (i.e., chromosome), while the second states that they must be on the same strand. The remaining rules constrain relationships between the start and stop positions of the Locations such that the desired relationship holds. Any kind of relationship that can be expressed in terms of relationships between Location Attributes can be represented in this way."	TRAIN	GGEN

This is because, the Euclidean distance does not consider whether the line segment crosses shape boundaries.,	VAL	D3DR

From the comparison of two predictions (a) we obtain three differentiated sets of intron assemblies (IAs): the set of IAs that are identical in both transcripts ('A and B'), and two set of the IAs that are in one prediction but not in the other ('A not B' and 'B not A'). When two sets have the same intron with different outside boundaries for the flanking exons these boundaries are taken from the intersection of the exons. Ensembl predictions (b) have in general more than one transcript per gene (two top yellow tracks). The intersecting intron assemblies (IAs) are therefore defined as the longest non-redundant IAs common between the transcripts from either prediction. For the novel IAs we take the longest non-redundant IAs in one that are not present in the other set.	VAL	GGEN

Potential CCD-like features of Afrotheria optimized on a mammalian phylogeny [44]. Data on age at eruption are not yet known for small afrotherians (tenrecs, golden moles, sengis) or aardvarks. Based on the metric data presented in Figure 2 and in the text, we predict that when such data are available, age at complete cheek tooth eruption in small afrotherians will greatly postdate age at female sexual maturity (corresponding to long, horizontal red lines in elephants, hyraxes and manatees). Ages at completion of dental eruption in  Trichechus  and  Petrogale concinna  are arbitrarily set at the end of their recorded lifespan, reflecting the fact that these animals continually erupt supernumerary teeth. Dotted vertical lines represent 1.0 ratio of age at complete dental eruption/age at female sexual maturity (red, scale at bottom) and possession of 19 thoracolumbar vertebrae (blue, scale at top). Boxes at the center represent characters relating to phenotype observed in at least some afrotheres and human CCD patients, as follows: AN, unfused and projecting anterior nasal (black); MS, unfused metopic suture (black); PF, palatal fenestrae (black); CL, absent clavicles (black); TC, non-descended testicles (black), abdominal and ascrotal testicles (gray), scrotal testicles (white); VN, vertebral number (20 or more, black; 19 or less, white); DE, delayed eruption (after twice age at female sexual maturity, black; at or near female maturity, white). Scandentia, Dermoptera and Pholidota are not included owing to lack of data on dental ontogeny. Ages at female sexual maturity are taken from [45] except where indicated in Additional file  1 . Vertebral data for sea cows represent averages from [49].  Petrogale  is coded based on  P. concinna  for age at complete dental eruption and  P. penicillata  for thoracolumbar vertebral number owing to the lack of intact skeletons of the former in available collections.,	TRAIN	GGEN

A, B , Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of monosynaptic EPSCs in an SG neuron in a slice from a normal animal (A) and in another SG neuron in a slice from an arthritic animal (B, 6 h postinduction of arthritis). CGRP (10 nM) potentiated synaptic transmission more strongly in arthritis than under normal conditions. Square wave electrical stimuli of 150  Î¼ s duration were delivered at a frequency  <  0.25 Hz. Each trace is the average of 8 ï¿½ï¿½ 10 EPSCs.  C , Concentration-response data show that the maximum effect (efficacy) of CGRP was significantly greater in SG neurons from arthritic rats (n = 16) compared to control neurons from normal animals (n = 10). Peak EPSC amplitudes during each concentration of CGRP were averaged and expressed as percent of predrug (baseline) control (100%). Sigmoid curves were fitted to the data using the following formula for nonlinear regression (GraphPad Prism 3.0;  Y  =  A +( B - A )/[1+(10 C /10 X ) D ], where  A  = bottom plateau,  B  = top plateau,  C  = log(EC50),  D  = slope coefficient.

In addition, the  fnbA  gene sequences from MSSA 476 (ST-1); N315 (ST-5); MRSA252 (ST-36); COL (ST-250); RF122 (ST-151) as well as the archetype  fnbA  sequence from 8325-4 (ST-8) were included. The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method [43]. Neighbour-joining trees were constructed using  fnbA  DNA sequences encoding the sub-domains N1 (a), N2 (b) and N3 (c) using MEGA 3. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (500 replicates) are shown next to the branches [44]. The phylogenetic tree was linearized assuming equal evolutionary rates in all lineages [45] . The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site.	TEST	GGEN

Panel A shows the histograms representing the distribution of cells in each phase of the cell cycle observed by FACS analysis performed 16 hours after a 1 h stimulation of CH1 cells with anti-IgM. An arrest in cell cycle is clearly evident here, with a greater than 2-fold increase in the G1 phase population. Also shown in the inset is the result of a Western blot analysis revealing accumulation of p27 upon anti-IgM stimulation over the course of time. Panel B depicts the activation profiles of fourteen signaling intermediates probed by Western blots (see text for details and Additional File  1 : Supplemental Fig. S1A) after anti-IgM stimulation. The plot represents mean value of quantified, normalized fold change in phosphorylation of the signaling intermediates in a time dependant manner obtained from three individual replicates and the over all S.D observed was  <  10%. Also refer Additional File  1 : Supplemental Fig. S1B for a detailed plot of the figure. An Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of the set of early induced genes upon anti-IgM stimulation of CH1 cells is shown in Panel C. This network depicts the core module identified by IPA based on the list of early-induced genes used as the seed nodes. Here, the nodes in red represent the over-expressed genes while those in green are those whose expression was found to suppressed (Detailed key in Additional file  1 ). The canonical pathways identified by IPA for the set of early induced genes in CH1 cells and their corresponding significant levels of contribution by the early induced genes is shown in Panel D.

Arachidonic acid is the substrate for eicosanoid production, prostaglandins via cyclooxygenase and leukotrienes via lipoxygenase. Lyso-PAF is acetylated by PAF-acetyl transferase releasing PAF that can be degraded by PAF-acetyl hydrolase that hydrolyses PAF regenerating Lyso-PAF. In the presence of dexamethasone the immune responses are inhibited due to the suppression of phospholipase A 2  activity with lower production of eicosanoids and PAF. On the other hand when exogenous arachidonic acid is added there is enhancement of eicosanoid production and immune responses increase.,	TRAIN	GCHE
